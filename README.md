# machine_learning_2018_spring
I will upload my code in machine learning course in 2018 Spring, which is guided by [Prof Deyu Meng](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/dymeng).

The topics mainly include: [pca](https://github.com/liziniu/machine_learning_2018_spring/tree/master/pca), [k-means](https://github.com/liziniu/machine_learning_2018_spring/tree/master/k-means), [supprot vector machine](https://github.com/liziniu/machine_learning_2018_spring/tree/master/svm) and etc.

I implement the most of algorithms by python. Hope it will help you!
