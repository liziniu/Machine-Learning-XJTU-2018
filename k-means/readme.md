This part is the implementation of k-means. 

I recommend you to understand the theory from 《Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning》.

I use sklearn to generate raw data(with 10 fetures and 3 classes). The raw data is here(I use the first two features to plot this).

After clustering, the results is here(note that I use [t-sne](https://github.com/liziniu/machine_learning_2018_spring/blob/master/k-means/t-sne-tutorial.ipynb) to visualize the high dimensional data!)

And also I use this algorithm to image segmentation. The following is final results.
