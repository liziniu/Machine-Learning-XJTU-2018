This part is the implementation of pca(principle component analysis). It is a powerful tool to reduce dimension. Sometimes, it can also be used to visualize high-dimension data.

Again, I use the [digits datasets](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html) from sklearn module. Here is the results(reduced to 2 dimension)

You can compare it to the results of [t-sne](https://github.com/liziniu/machine_learning_2018_spring/blob/master/k-means/t-sne-tutorial.ipynb)
